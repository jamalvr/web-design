# web-design
The first demo for testing usability for the course 'webdesign'. I'll be creating an overview of different photo's, which provider a larger version of the photo and more information when you click on it. The user should have clear understanding what the site is about when they enter the website.

## Design principles used
For this assignment we must use at least three principles from the [list of 20 design principles.](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)

### First version
The first version of the design I made for the overview of 'pretty pictures'. With this design I can test it with users to see if the chosen principles work like they're supposed to.

#### "6 One primary action per screen"
Having one primary action per screen should make it easier to understand what a user should do. WHen there aree multiple primary actions, the user can become confused quite quickly. With this thought in mind, the user only has one primary action they can fulfill on each of the three screens I created.

#### "10 Consistency matters"
Only  elements that behave consistent should look consistent. There are numerous buttons/actions on the screens, and all of them behave differently and because they behave differently, they come with their own style. This way there is a clear distinction between the actions and that they behave differently.

#### "11. Strong visual hierarchies work best"
In each screen I have tried to create a clear viewing order for the user. I've done this with different font-sizes, colors, backgrounds and panels that have a bigger `box shadow`.
