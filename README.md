The first demo for testing usability for the course 'webdesign'. I'll be creating an overview of different photo's, which provider a larger version of the photo and more information when you click on it.

## Design principles used
For this assignment we must use at least three principles from the list of 20 design principles. [list of 20 design principles.](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)

The first version of the design I made for the overview of 'pretty pictures'. With this design I can test it with users to see if the chosen principles work like they're supposed to.
