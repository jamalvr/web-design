                    <p>Clarity is the first and most important job of any interface. To be effective using an interface you've
                        designed, people must be able to recognize what it is, care about why they would use it, understand
                        what the interface is helping them interact with, predict what will happen when they use it, and
                        then successfully interact with it. While there is room for mystery and delayed gratification in
                        interfaces, there is no room for confusion. Clarity inspires confidence and leads to further use.
                        One hundred clear screens is preferable to a single cluttered one.</p>

                    <p>Interfaces exist to enable interaction between humans and our world. They can help clarify, illuminate,
                        enable, show relationships, bring us together, pull us apart, manage our expectations, and give us
                        access to services. The act of designing interfaces is not Art. Interfaces are not monuments unto
                        themselves. Interfaces do a job and their effectiveness can be measured. They are not just utilitarian,
                        however. The best interfaces can inspire, evoke, mystify, and intensify our relationship with the
                        world.

                        with distractible material…remember why the screen exists in the first place. If someone is reading
                        let them finish reading before showing that advertisement (if you must). Honor attention and not
                        only will your readers be happier, your results will be better. When use is the primary goal, attention
                        becomes the prerequisite. Conserve it at all costs.</p>

                    <p>Humans are most comfortable when they feel in control of themselves and their environment. Thoughtless
                        software takes away that comfort by forcing people into unplanned interactions, confusing pathways,
                        and surprising outcomes. Keep users in control by regularly surfacing system status, by describing
                        causation (if you do this that will happen) and by giving insight into what to expect at every turn.
                        Don't worry about stating the obvious…the obvious almost never is.</p>

                    <p>The best interface is none at all, when we are able to directly manipulate the physical objects in our
                        world. Since this is not always possible, and objects are increasingly informational, we create interfaces
                        to help us interact with them. It is easy to add more layers than necessary to an interface, creating
                        overly-wrought buttons, chrome, graphics, options, preferences, windows, attachments, and other cruft
                        so that we end up manipulating UI elements instead of what's important. Instead, strive for that
                        original goal of direct manipulation…design an interface with as little a footprint as possible,
                        recognizing as much as possible natural human gestures. Ideally, the interface is so slight that
                        the user has a feeling of direct manipulation with the object of their focus.</p>

                        support two or more primary actions become confusing quickly. Like a written article should have
                        a single, strong thesis, every screen we design should support a single, strong action that is its
                        raison d'etre.</p>

                        it. Just as we like in human conversation, provide an opening for further interaction. Don't leave
                        a person hanging because they've done what you want them to do…give them a natural next step that
                        helps them further achieve their goals.</p>

                        software. When someone or something behaves consistently with our expectations we feel like we have
                        a good relationship with it. To that end designed elements should look like how they behave. Form
                        follows function. In practice this means that someone should be able to predict how an interface
                        element will behave merely by looking at it. If it looks like a button it should act like a button.
                        Don't get cute with the basics of interaction…keep your creativity for higher order concerns.</p>

                        elements to appear consistent. In an effort to be consistent novice designers often obscure important
                        differences by using the same visual treatment (often to re-use code) when different visual treatment
                        is appropriate.</p>

                        In environments of great change it is hard to maintain a strong visual hierarchy because visual weight
                        is relative: when everything is bold, nothing is bold. Should a single visually heavy element be
                        added to a screen, the designer may need to reset the visual weight of all elements to once again
                        achieve a strong hierarchy. Most people don't notice visual hierarchy but it is one of the easiest
                        ways to strengthen (or weaken) a design.</p>

                    <p>As John Maeda says in his book Simplicity, smart organization of screen elements can make the many appear
                        as the few. This helps people understand your interface easier and more quickly, as you've illustrated
                        the inherent relationships of content in your design. Group together like elements, show natural
                        relationships by placement and orientation. By smartly organizing your content you make it less of
                        a cognitive load on the user…who doesn't have to think about how elements are related because you've
                        done it for them. Don't force the user to figure things out…show them by designing those relationships
                        into your screens.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The color of physical things changes as light changes. In the full light of day we see a very different
                        tree than one outlined against a sunset. As in the physical world, where color is a many-shaded thing,
                        color should not determine much in an interface. It can help, be used for highlighting, be used to
                        guide attention, but should not be the only differentiator of things. For long-reading or extended
                        screen hours, use light or muted background colors, saving brighter hues for your accent colors.
                        Of course there is a time for vibrant background colors as well, just be sure that it is appropriate
                        for your audience.</p>

                        or show everything all at once. When possible, defer decisions to subsequent screens by progressively
                        disclosing information as necessary. This will keep your interactions more clear.</p>

                    <p>In ideal interfaces, help is not necessary because the interface is learnable and usable. The step below
                        this, reality, is one in which help is inline and contextual, available only when and where it is
                        needed, hidden from view at all other times. Asking people to go to help and find an answer to their
                        question puts the onus on them to know what they need. Instead build in help where it is needed…just
                        make sure that it is out of the way of people who already know how to use your interface.</p>

                    <p>The first time experience with an interface is crucial, yet often overlooked by designers. In order to
                        best help our users get up to speed with our designs, it is best to design for the zero state, the
                        state in which nothing has yet occurred. This state shouldn't be a blank canvas…it should provide
                        direction and guidance for getting up to speed. Much of the friction of interaction is in that initial
                        context…once people understand the rules they have a much higher likelihood of success.</p>

                    <p>A curious property of great design is that it usually goes unnoticed by the people who use it. One reason
                        for this is that if the design is successful the user can focus on their own goals and not the interface…when
                        they complete their goal they are satisfied and do not need to reflect on the situation. As a designer
                        this can be tough…as we receive less adulation when our designs are good. But great designers are
                        content with a well-used design…and know that happy users are often silent.</p>

                    <p>As in most design disciplines, interface design is successful when people are using what you've designed.
                        Like a beautiful chair that is uncomfortable to sit in, design has failed when people choose not
                        to use it. Therefore, interface design can be as much about creating an environment for use as it
                        is creating an artifact worth using. It is not enough for an interface to satisfy the ego of its
                        designer: it must be used!</p>
