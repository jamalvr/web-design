# Web Design project
In this project I'm creating a website for a user with severe motor dissability (Marijn). I've chosen for the case to create a learning environment for the minor Webdevelopment.

## Getting started
To get a general idea of the content that is needed for the website, I went to our current learning environment (Moodle). I wrote down all the things that we're important for the minor Webdevelopment, and added things I felt where missing.

### Card sorting
After my content-research, I sat down with some people to discuss the content and order them through card sorting. It was a relatively easy process, since we we're on the same page from the start. Some had valid points that the other did not, which resulted in a more detailed version of our content research.

### User scenarios
To simmulate the right flow for the user I created a couple of user scenarios. With the user scenarios I'm able to realisticly test how the user will walk through my website.
* As a __student following the minor web-development__, I want see __information about the different courses__, so I can __easily find the course assignments & schedules__.
* As a __person interested in following the minor web-develpment__, I want to see __which courses are available__, so that I have a __quick understanding of what the minor has to offer__.

## Website flow
The user will enter the website on a dashboard. There the user will find general information to have quick acces to the most important general information available.
