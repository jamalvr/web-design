                <p>Clarity is the first and most important job of any interface. <span class="text-highlight">To be effective using an interface you've designed,
                    people must be able to recognize what it is, care about why they would use it, understand what the interface
                    is helping them interact with, predict what will happen when they use it, and then successfully interact
                    with it.</span> While there is room for mystery and delayed gratification in interfaces, there is no room for
                    confusion. Clarity inspires confidence and leads to further use. One hundred clear screens is preferable
                    to a single cluttered one.</p>
